String types
==============

Aroop contains special support for strings. While `string` class is originally the character array in C output, the `xtring` contains some extra features. Xtring has support for,

- Embeded/stack allocated container.
- Stack allocated string.
- Heap allocated string.
- A hash value and precalculated length value.
- There are plans to implement immutable strings.

The `extring` is of `struct` type so it can reduce memory allocation in some cases. It supports [flyweight pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight_pattern) to reduce data duplication and copying. You can always get _extring_ from _xtring_ calling fly() method.

Declaration
=============

The strings can be referenced in your code when it is allocated in heap. You can avoid memory copy by just referencing the heap string. For example, if you have a string named `hello`, you may define it like the following.

```vala
xtring hello = new xtring.copy_static_string("hello");
```

This will allocate a memory in heap for *xtring* structure as well as the "hello" string. You can do either [deep_copy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_copy#Deep_copy) or [shallow_copy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_copy#Shallow_copy) or [copy_on_demand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_copy#Lazy_copy) of this string.

Again you can also allocate memory in stack.

```vala
extring hello = new extring.set_static_string("hello");
```

The above code will keep the string totally in stack memory. You may also allocate stack memory if you want like the following.

```vala
extring hello = new extring.stack(128);
hello.concat_string("hello");
```

Copying
=======

Now suppose you want to pass by value and set the extring parameter to a method. You can do that like the following.

```vala
public void getAs(extring*content) {
	content.rebuild_and_copy_on_demand(&cache);
}
```

Sandbox
========
You can copy a string into stack for processing.

```vala
extring sandbox = extring.stack_copy_extring(immutablextring);
```

Factory
========

You can also create factory for string and build them.

```vala
SearchableFactory<xtring> myTxtFactory = SearchableFactory<xtring>.for_type(); // XXX should we memclean the memory ?
SearchableString x = myTxtFactory.alloc_added_size(src.length()+1);
x.tdata.factory_build_and_copy_on_tail_no_length_check(&src);
```

Error generated by returning extring in a method
===============================================

Suppose you have an instance variable of type extring. If you return this in a method, then it will be freed in the caller function resulting in double free. You need to take special care about this.
