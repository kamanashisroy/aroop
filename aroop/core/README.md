aroop core
===========

This is complimentary C library for the aroop generated code.

Building
========

Building core library binary is trivial. You need to put `make` command and that is all.

```
a/aroop$ cd aroop/core
a/aroop/aroop/core$ make
...
...
a/aroop/aroop/core$ ls
libaroop_core_static.a libaroop_core_debug.a libaroop_core_basic.o  libaroop_core.o 
```

After build we shall get the object files(*libaroop_core_basic.o*,*libaroop_core.o*) and also an archive(*libaroop_core.a*). You may link them to your binary using `-laroop\_core` flag. Otherwise you can also link the object file(*libaroop_core.o*) with the binary.
